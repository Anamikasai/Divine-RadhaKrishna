        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
         <li>According to Hindu scriptures like the Bhagavata Purana, Radha was a cowherd girl in Vrindavan, a village in ancient India, and Krishna was a divine prince. Their love story unfolds amidst the pastoral settings of Vrindavan, where Krishna spent his early years as a cowherd. Radha, known for her unparalleled beauty, was deeply enamored with Krishna, and their love was pure, selfless, and eternal.
